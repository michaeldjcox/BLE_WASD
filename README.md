# BLE_WASD
Bluetooth enabled WASD keyboard
See https://hackaday.io/project/7646-ble-wasdmechanical-keyboard for build instructions!

This fork contains improvements from original to

a) fix some bugs
b) add two way PS2 comms so that capslock/numlock/scrolllock LEDS work
c) provide an option "wired" mode. The tought here is to be able to use as a wired keyboard without unplugging the bluefruit from the keyboard and possibly benefit from some improved reduction in latecy when we are wired.

WORK IN PROGRESS
